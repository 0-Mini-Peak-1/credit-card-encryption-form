Don't forget to pip install!

Flask
cryptography
pyngrok
python-dotenv

for terminal pasting:
pip install Flask cryptography pyngrok python-dotenv 

or:
pip3 install Flask cryptography pyngrok python-dotenv

Btw, I recommend running this app on your own machine since I didn't write the google drive mount functinality :/
Also I did a port fix for macOS already so enjoy kub :)
